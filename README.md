## About Me

Hey, I’m **Jie** — a QA Engineer who genuinely enjoys making things work better.  
I’m the kind of person who notices small details but also likes seeing the bigger picture of how everything fits together.  

I’ve loved QA ever since I graduated. Back in college, I tested our thesis project and was honestly fascinated by how something as simple as testing could be so enjoyable - finding issues, understanding how things break, and figuring out how to make them better. That experience made me realize it’s something I’d love to do as a career.

Right now, I’m focused on growing my automation skills and improving my testing process.  
My goal is simple: keep learning, keep shipping quality work, and become the kind of QA who helps a team move faster and smarter.
